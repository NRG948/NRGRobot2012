Minimum Programming Tasks On the box

1. Calibrate the Arm, setpoints and PID all calibrated (button 10 on backup) //5 minutes

Stow - 669
Shoot - 700
Bridge - 418
Check-done :D

2. Make sure manipulator motors (tower, rollers) are running in the right direction (button 11) //1 minute MINIMUM(5 min max hopefully)
    final static int GYRO_RESET_BUTTON = 7;
    final static int KNOB_RESET_BUTTON = 8;    
    final static int PID_INITIALIZE_STEERING_BUTTON = 9;
    final static int PID_INTIALIZE_MANIPULATOR_BUTTON = 7;
    final static int MAE_CALIBRATE_BUTTON = 6;

    // backup joystick buttons
    final static int FL_UPDATE_BUTTON = 2;
    final static int FR_UPDATE_BUTTON = 3;
    final static int BL_UPDATE_BUTTON = 4;
    final static int BR_UPDATE_BUTTON = 5;
Need to do this

3. Calibrate the MAES on wheels, chains on left; make sure they don't slip //5 minutes
Did this once, not sure it was successful

4. Wheels are moving in their expected directions(in both swerve and tank) //2 minute(minimum), 10 min max hopefully
No idea
Minimum Tasks on the Floor

1. Calibrate Steering PID Values(Knob?) //15 minutes

2. Start driving around, be sure to reset gyro each time we start //5 minutes

3. Calibrate shoot speed //5 minutes

4. Autonomous 

    a. Shoot Command - 15 minutes
    b. Twist Command - 15 minutes
    c. Move Command - 15 minutes

5. Autonomous switches - 1 hour(10 per starting position)

Optional Tasks On the Floor

1. Try camera servo again? Also is it a good angle? // 15 min

2. Adjust PID on arm
